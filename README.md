New York City is a formidable place to all who call it home, and at some point we are all faced with a crisis or challenge that is beyond the scope of what we can manage.

There are hundreds of government and non-profit organizations whose purpose is to offer aid and assistance to New Yorkers.

The City has compiled these extensive facility listings in its NYC Open Data project under "NYC Women's Resource Network Database."

City government websites with hundreds of entries can be just as daunting as the problem itself.

I wanted to parse through these entries by their borough location and designated category so that women seeking these social services would not feel overwhelmed by the considerable content, but invited and encouraged to use these services with a user-friendly format and simple, intuitive design.

These NYC facilities offer a range of services in the following areas: aging, anti-discrimination, child care, volunteer, support groups, domestic violence, disabilities, employment, education, homeless, housing, immigration, legal services, LGBTQ, victim services, youth services, and veteran services.

It's important for us all to feel like we are part of a community. These institutions can offer assistance but may also strenghthen community ties for all who partake.

User Stories
A woman in New York City has little free time if she's juggling motherhood, work, and her other adulting responsibilies. This site allows her to access facility information, such as the location, phone number, URL, and description, in a timely and efficient way.

Users may also be curious about the different facilities serving New Yorkers and can use this site to offer their assistance through volunteering time or donations. 

Academics in the social sciences can also benefit from the listings when conducting their own data compilations and surveys for research.

Getting Started:
Search for a facility by clicking on a borough name in the navigation bar or a category name in the body. Once you are redirected, scroll through the listings. Depending on the data available for the New York City database, an organization name is sometimes hyperlinked to that facilty's own website. 

Contribution Guidelines:
The data being pulled from the NYC Open Data Network has some incomplete or out-dated information regarding location and contact information. It would be extremely helpful to offer an edit/delete function so users can update information based on their knowledge and experince with the facility.

This data is divided by category and borough but it would be helpful to divide the category listings further by borough or the borough listings further by category so that users who only want to see facilities in their borough based on their need can have immediate access to those options.

My Story:

I have been overwhelmed by the recent leaked Supreme Court draft that demonstrated a majority opinion for the overturn of Roe vs. Wade. As a woman, I feel that my bodily autonomy is being threatened. I am called to do more to fight for women's issues as this reveals a systematic and societal disregard for women's needs. 

When brainstorming project ideas, I wanted to create an application that would help give activists access to resources for organizing people or joining together. However, I could not find databases that supplied this information. 

When I came across the NYC Open Data project, I was stupefied by the amount of data that was available to the public. I knew that this information could help women if they knew about it and if it was more easily accessible. 

As my tech skills develop, I hope that I can contribute more to the causes that inspire and motivate me.
